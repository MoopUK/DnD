# The script of the game goes in this file.

# Initial Game Idea Draft:
    # - DND with Player needing money to get to somewhere to not miss an event...

    # - Your Little Timmy's first lute recital is why you need to go home lol idk

    # - You wake up after a HEAVY night of drinking, are infected with a brain worm, and
    # your coin purse is empty so you need to make money to get home within 72 hours.

    # - The best way to get cash is the snail races at the casino.
    # - This is because:
    #   - All monsters in the area have already been killed, and their rewards collected by another party
    #   - Your Lemonade stand would have worked but you get angry and break the lemonade stand

# Casino info:
    # - Each turn in the snail races at the casino will take [undecided]-hours of your time,
    # You really need to get home asap!

    # - It'll take 12 hours to get home? So Player needs to keep in mind 12 hours is needed spare to win.

    # - It will cost 50 gold to get home? And the coin purse will hold 100 coins maximum.
    # (Maybe the Casino will kick you out when you earn your maximum? And you go home as nothing else to do)

# Game Jam Limitation 'There is no end':
    # - There is no end - If you sucumb to the gambling addiction you could gamble to no end.
    # Rather than a game that is ongoing forever, this will technically have *endings*, but
    # it'll be a symbolic gambling addiction neverending situation at the *endings* of the game if you
    # don't walk away once you make enough to get home (50 gold minimum)


# The game starts here.
