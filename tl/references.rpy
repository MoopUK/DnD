# Initial references for all assets used, list will change if I swap things out before end of game jam.

# Not an asset but this game was inspired by one YouTube short I saw from an online DnD group
# https://youtube.com/shorts/J6fdwyJ9-_g?si=OCJw325FTy4k6ZTD
# I saw the theme 'speed' and wanted to make a DnD campaign all about snail racing
# I have never been a DM or played DnD before, but I've recently found and listened to that
# online group of players and find it funny.
